        <p>Some things in our life . .are beyond gratitude. . .</p>
        <p>Where words fail in gratitude. . .Love speaks out. . .</p>
        <p>And this is a Note Of Love . . .</p>
        <p>So . . .where should we start from. . .of course. . . the beginning !</p>
        <p>The child arrives like a mystery box…</p>
        <p>with puzzle pieces inside</p>
        <p>some of the pieces seems broken or missing…</p>
        <p>and others just seem to hide. . .</p>
        <p>There is aways some magical hands which sorts it out. . .</p>
        <p>This is about such hands. .</p>
        <p>Those magical hands in our life. . .</p>
        <p>The story of these people descents back to our childhood. . .</p>
        <p>When we were those little kids who just tightly clenched our mother's hand.</p>
        <p>Afraid to let her go. ... our little hearts were filled with auras of fear. . .we were missing our parents and home for the first time. . .being in a strange world . . .</p>
        <p>But suddenly somebody held our other hand out.. somebody who could shed off all our fears with a single touch ...</p>
        <p>Who stood close to us . . .and then became close to our hearts. . .who replaced that auras of fear with lessons of love and light of knowledge. . .</p>
        <p>They always had something special in them. . .</p>
        <p>What they wrote on blackboard were erased at times . . . not those what they wrote on our hearts. . .</p>
        <p>They were always there as rocks of our walls. .</p>
        <p>Their firm hands were always there to break our silly fights. . .</p>
        <p>Their unspoken words taught us love and compassion. . .</p>
        <p>People who still lend their guiding hands and an understanding smile. . .</p>
        <p>Who always gave us more than what we expected and still continues to do the same. . .</p>
        <p>Up to what height can a teacher ascend. . .??? a friend,? a guide, ?a mentor,? an educator. .?</p>
        <p>Those people who still guides us to tread the roads of our life. . .</p>
        <p>the HEARTS which sort those missing,</p>
        <p>broken and hidden pieces out…</p>
        <p>which helps us to see</p>
        <p>the potential for greatness we have within…</p>
        <p>and a picture of what we can be. . .</p>
        <p>Their goal wasn’t just to teach …</p>
        <p>but to fill our boxes with more parts</p>
        <p>and put those pieces together…</p>
        <p>to create a work of art. . .</p>
        <p>What was so special about them. . .?</p>
        <p>Nothing much. . but they all had a heart</p>
        <p>Which saw the unseen. . .</p>
        <p>Touched the untouched.</p>
        <p>Felt the unfelt. .  .</p>
        <p>And reached the unreached. . .</p>
        <p>The beings who illuminates our beings. .</p>
        <p>They didn't choose to teach. . But to live a life that matters.  ..</p>
        <p>They've given us their love. . And we could not ask for more. . .</p>
        <p>They've been our teachers. . .</p>
        <p>Those magicians of our life. . .</p>
        <p>Happy teacher’s day . . .to all our loving teachers. . .</p>
        <p>Love you a lotzz. . .</p>
        <p>With love</p>
