    <p>Some things in our life . .are beyond gratitude. . .</p>
    <p>Where words fail in gratitude. . .Love speaks out. . .</p>
    <p>And this is a Note Of Love . . .</p>
    <p>So . . .where should we start from. . .of course. . . the beginning !</p>
    <p>The child arrives like a mystery box… with puzzle pieces inside some of the pieces seems broken or missing… and others just seem to hide. . .</p>
    <p>There is aways some magical hands which sorts it out. . . This is about such hands. . Those magical hands in our life. . .</p>
    <p>The story of these people descents back to our childhood. . . When we were those little kids who just tightly clenched our mother's hand.</p>
    <p>Afraid to let her go. ... our little hearts were filled with auras of fear. . . we were missing our parents and home for the first time. . . being in a strange world . . .</p>
    <p>But suddenly somebody held our other hand out.. somebody who could shed off all our fears with a single touch ...</p>
    <p>Who stood close to us . . . and then became close to our hearts. . . who replaced that auras of fear with lessons of love and light of knowledge. . .</p>
    <p>They always had something special in them. . . What they wrote on blackboard were erased at times . . . not those what they wrote on our hearts. . .</p>
    <p>They were always there as rocks of our walls. .</p>
    <p>Their firm hands were always there to break our silly fights. . .</p>
    <p>Their unspoken words taught us love and compassion. . .</p>
    <p>People who still lend their guiding hands and an understanding smile. . .</p>
    <p>Who always gave us more than what we expected and still continues to do the same. . .</p>
    <p>Up to what height can a teacher ascend. . .??? a friend,? a guide, ?a mentor,? an educator. .?</p>
    <p>Those people who still guides us to tread the roads of our life. . .</p>
    <p>the HEARTS which sort those missing, broken and hidden pieces out… which helps us to see the potential for greatness we have within… and a picture of what we can be. . .</p>
    <p>Their goal wasn’t just to teach … but to fill our boxes with more parts and  put those pieces together… to create a work of art. . .</p>
    <p>What was so special about them. . .? Nothing much. . but they all had a heart Which saw the unseen. . . Touched the untouched. Felt the unfelt. .  . And reached the unreached. . .</p>
    <p>The beings who illuminates our beings. . They didn't choose to teach. . But to live a life that matters.  ..</p>
    <p>They've given us their love. . And we could not ask for more. . . They've been our teachers. . . Those magicians of our life. . .</p>
    <p>Happy teacher’s day . . .to all our loving teachers. . .</p>
    <p>Love you a lotzz. . .</p>
    <p>With love<br/>Anora Anish</p>
